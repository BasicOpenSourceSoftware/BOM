# BOM
BOM stands for BasicOpenMacro as the name suggests BOM is a basic opensource macro written in Python 3.9.7. It is meant to have no extra features and be as secure as possible. This is only a text macro it will not do any keyboard shortcuts it will only type the text you setup with the key bind you setup. BOM is for windows only.

The ZIP file is a compiled version using py2exe. There is no insaller but you will want to unZIP the file then use the exe to launch the application. You can also make a short cut it does not matter where you save the folder.

Please note that to make a key bind you have to use a capital letter. The software only allows you to use ctrl + alt + (the key bind you set) I will probably not add the ability to change that. If you have any questions please email me at BasicOpenSourceSoftware@gmail.com.
