# BOM
BOM stands for BasicOpenMacro as the name suggests BOM is a basic opensource macro written in Python 3.9.7. It is meant to have no extra features and be as secure as possible. This is only a text macro it will not do any keyboard shortcuts it will only type the text you setup with the key bind you setup. BOM is for windows only.

The release ZIP file is a compiled version using py2exe. There is no insaller but you will want to unZIP the file then use the exe to launch the application. You can also make a short cut it does not matter where you save the folder.

THE RELEASE FILE IS OUTDATED. I will be uploading a new compiled version next time I have access to my desktop.

Please note that to make a key bind you have to use a capital letter. The software only allows you to use ctrl + alt + (the key bind you set) I will probably not add the ability to change that. If you have any questions please email me at BasicOpenSourceSoftware@gmail.com.

The default delay is 0.3

After making a change click save and you should be good to go! There is a file that is saved with your keybinds and text. Please be aware of that if you put a password in the macro the save file is not encrypted although that may be in a later update.

There is no copy right on this project, although I would appriciate if anyone who uses the code from my projects give some credit or a mention.
